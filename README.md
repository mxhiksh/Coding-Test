This repo is to demonstrate my skills in Web scrapping and Machine Learning 

Problem 1:


Wikipedia gives filmography of actors based on actor name
Since there is no standard website to extract films, I am using this wiki page for the extraction of data
Example of URL of website is,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiranjeevi_filmography
