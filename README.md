This repo is to demonstrate my skills in Web scrapping and Machine Learning 

Problem 1:


Wikipedia gives filmography of actors based on actor name.
Since there is no standard website to extract films, I am using this wiki page for the extraction of data. 
Example of URL of website is,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiranjeevi_filmography


"Wikipedia provides a comprehensive list of movies featuring actors categorized by their names. As there isn't a universally recognized website specifically designed for extracting film data, I rely on Wikipedia pages like this one to gather information. For instance, you can find a sample website URL here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiranjeevi_filmography."
