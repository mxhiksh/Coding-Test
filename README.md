Problem 1:

Wikipedia provides a comprehensive list of movies featuring actors categorized by their names. As there isn't a universally recognized website specifically designed for extracting film data, I rely on Wikipedia pages like this one to gather information. 
For instance, you can find a sample website URL here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiranjeevi_filmography.
